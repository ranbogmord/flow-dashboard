# Parallel42 Flow Dashboard

Dashboard widget inspired by our favourite TBM pilot, showing speed (IAS) and heading (based on gyro).

Above 237kts the speed tape range changes to 0-500kts. The speed where it switches can be changed in the settings.

Can be dragged and dropped to wherever you want it on the screen. You can resize it by changing the "Widget size" in the settings.
